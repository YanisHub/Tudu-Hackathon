TUDU Product Vision
Objective
Design a digital platform that allows students to delegate their university projects to other qualified students or freelancers, in exchange for payment. This marketplace aims to simplify the management of complex and time-consuming assignments by connecting those who want to outsource their projects with those who can complete them efficiently.

Key Features
1. Authentication & Onboarding
Secure sign-up and login system (email, password, etc.).

After registration, users are prompted to complete their profile (name, university, skills, etc.).

If the profile is already complete, the user is automatically redirected to their personal dashboard.

2. User Interface
An intuitive interface with a sidebar to navigate between:

My Orders: projects created by the user.

Work to Do: projects the user has accepted.

Marketplace: list of open projects available for applications.

Profile: personal info, skills, history, etc.

Business Features
3. Project Creation & Management
Users can create a project with:

Title

Description

Required skills

Once published, the project appears in the marketplace.

The creator can track its progress through the “My Orders” page.

4. Project Lifecycle
Each project follows a standardized 5-stage lifecycle:

Draft: project is being written.

Open for Applications: visible on the marketplace.

In Progress: a provider has been selected.

In Review: project has been delivered, awaiting approval.

Completed / Cancelled: project is either finalized or interrupted.

5. Selection Process & Secure Payment
Interested users can apply to an open project.

The project creator selects a provider among the applicants.

Upon selection, client funds are held in escrow.

The project status changes to "In Progress", and a dedicated chat opens.

6. Integrated Messaging
Real-time chat system between the project owner and the provider.

Centralized exchange of messages and files.

7. Delivery, Validation & Payment
Once delivered, the client may request a revision or approve the project.

Upon approval, funds are released to the provider.

In case of disputes, a support system may be implemented later.
